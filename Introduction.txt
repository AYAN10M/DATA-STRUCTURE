What is Data Structure ?
Data Structure is a way of organizing data in such a way that we can perform operations on the data in an effective way.

Data structures are classified into two categories:
a) linear [array, linked list]
b) nonlinear [tree, graph]
The elements in a linear data structure form a sequence, whereas elements in a nonlinear data structure do not.
