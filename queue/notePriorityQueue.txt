A priority queue is an abstract data type in which each element is assigned a priority. The priority of the element will be used to determine the order in which the element will be processed

    -> Element with higher priority is processed before an element with lower priority
    -> Two elements with the same priority are processed on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis


Difference between Priority Queue and Normal Queue

    In a queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a priority queue, the values are removed on the basis of priority. The element with the highest priority is removed first.


Implementation of Priority Queue

    Priority queue can be implemented using an array, a linked list, a heap data structure, or a binary search tree. Among these data structures, heap data structure provides an efficient implementation of priority queues.
